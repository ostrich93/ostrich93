### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Connecticut College in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science. From February 2019 through November 2022, I worked as an Associate Consultant at Atos Syntel, where I assisted two major Fortune 500 companies in migrating legacy code and developing applications and services for their next-gen software platforms. I finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](www.recurse.com/) in early 2023 and am now looking for work.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: [The Arboria Engine](https://github.com/ostrich93/Arboria) - A 2D game engine that began development at Recurse to learn C, C++, and performance-critical programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: C, C++, C#, OpenGL
